Subject: [PATCH] ui/sdl2: Don't disable scanout when display is refreshed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Display refreshment is invoked by a timer and it erroneously disables
the active scanout if it happens to be invoked after scanout has been
enabled. This offending scanout-disable race condition with a timer
can be easily hit when Qemu runs with a disabled vsync by using SDL or
GTK displays (with vblank_mode=0 for GTK). Refreshment of display's
content shouldn't disable the active display. Fix it by keeping the
scanout's state unchanged when display is redrawn.
